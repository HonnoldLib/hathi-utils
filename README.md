use oclc numbers to retrieve hathi trust data

We need to check the availability in Hathi Trust of bibliographic items represented by OCLC Numbers. The script(s) here enable look-up, and retrieval of summary data.

## Notes:
HathiTrust and OCLC records
OCLC and the HathiTrust work together to synchronize WorldCat with the HathiTrust catalog nightly.  The vast majority of records representing the HathiTrust collection are in WorldCat today, with links to the HathiTrust content.
